We try to estimate an accurate production time right as you configure your furniture online. However, each shelf is custom made, so depending on the colour, materials, and number of other pieces in the production queue, there can be a little variation. The good news is that once your furniture is ready to ship, it only takes a few days upon leaving our factory to arrive at your door.

Right now, the total time to receive your order from production to delivery is about 6 weeks. Please keep in mind that this can change depending on how quickly we're able to build and ship, so your wait may even be shorter. You can always check the progress of your order for updated timelines, but please not that the date given is the estimate of when your shelf will ship from our factory, not be delivered.
