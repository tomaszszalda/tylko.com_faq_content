We'll send you an email each time your order status changes (for example when your order is finished moving through production, or when it's ready to leave our factory) and with regular shipping updates so you can track its progress and know when to expect it at your door, too.\
You can also track your order [here](https://tylko.com/contact/?topic=order_status).
