Fortunately, we can confirm that only 7% of our UK customers are receiving different parts of their orders at separate times. Delivery times of the packages that are held at customs might increase by an additional 2-5 days. For now, we have no influence over the extended custom checks. To get more information about the status of your packages, we suggest that you get in touch with the courier company directly. Or if you prefer, contact us and we'll forward you any relevant updates as soon as we're informed.
