Taxes, right? Ugh, we know they can be a pain, but luckily we make them easy to handle. If you're ordering your furniture for delivery in Germany, but transporting it to Switzerland, all you have to do is get your invoice stamped at the border and then send us a copy [via email](javascript:window.scrollToFAQContactForm();) for reimbursement. Simple!
