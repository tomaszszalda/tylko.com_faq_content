Luckily, our operations havn't been severely affected. As all of our orders are made online, our customers have remained safe – and still able to design their dream furniture and get it delivered free right from the comfort of their homes.

We created our business model to eliminate as many middlemen as possible, too. This means your shelf is made to order, then comes directly from our factories where increased safety precautions have been implemented. We don’t have warehouses or shops, which means your furniture comes straight from us, and is delivered safely to you - with as few people involved as possible.

Things are ticking along well here at Tylko, as we continue to offer free delivery for our products all over Europe. You can get started designing yours [here](https://tylko.com/shelves/)!
