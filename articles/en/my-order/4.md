No. Once your order is submitted, it gets sent straight to our factory where our team gets to work. Because of this super streamlined system, it's nearly impossible to change the design, the materials or the delivery address. If changing your order is super urgent, you can [email us here](javascript:window.scrollToFAQContactForm();) and we'll try to help you out.
