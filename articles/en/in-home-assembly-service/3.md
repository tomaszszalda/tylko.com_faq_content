If you ordered a Type03 Wardrobe, your in-home assembly service is totally free. If you ordered a Type01 or Type02 (or both!), your assembly fee will depend on the number of items you bought and their complexity. The price will be added automatically to your order when you choose "Add assembly" at checkout.
