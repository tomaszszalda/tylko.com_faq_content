Forgot to add assembly? No worries - if you're shopping from Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland or France (excluding Ile de Corse and other French territorial islands) just [shoot our customer service team an email](javascript:window.scrollToFAQContactForm();) and we'll help you out.
