If you're ordering a Type03 Wardrobe, assembly is included for free, and will be added automatically to your order.

If you're ordering a Type01 or Type02 and would like to add assembly services, we can help - but only if you're shopping from Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland or France (excluding Ile de Corse and other French territorial islands). Just add your items to your cart, then click the ""Add Assembly"" button to the right and the extra charge for the service will be added to your total cost.
