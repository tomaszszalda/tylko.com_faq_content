If you would like to add assembly services, we can help - but only if you're shopping from Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Switzerland or France (excluding Ile de Corse and other French territorial islands). Just add your items to your cart, then click the ""Add Assembly"" button to the right and the extra charge for the service will be added to your total cost.

If you're looking for a little help with assembly outside of Europe, we might be able to help. [Send us a little more information](javascript:window.scrollToFAQContactForm();) about where you are and what you need, and our logistics manager will get back to you with a quote for your assembly service. However, our click-in, colour-coded assembly is really easy, and has been called ""Lego for adults""... you might want to give it a go! You'd be surprised how satisfying it is.
