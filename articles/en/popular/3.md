No, sorry, our furniture is designed to be floor-standing only. We recommend attaching your Tylko to the wall for extra stability and to prevent any tipping (especially for shelves over 60cm in height or 150cm wide), but mounting our shelves to hang freely without floor support is absolutely not recommended. We'd hate for them to be unsafe!
