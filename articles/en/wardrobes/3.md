Quick answer: you don't! We offer an in-home assembly service with every Wardrobe purchase to simplify your shopping experience (and let the experts handle the heavy lifting). Our professional assembly team will arrange a convenient time to assemble your Wardrobe, then arrive and get right to work. Depending on the size of the piece, they'll work as fast as possible, and will make sure every element in your flat pack order is in perfect condition as they assemble it vertically in place, right where you want it. They'll then secure it to the wall for extra safety with angled brackets, tidy up all boxes and packing materials and leave your space spotless - and with a perfectly-assembled new Wardrobe.
