We recommend every Tylko over 70cm in height be mounted to the wall for safety. You never know when there could be an earthquake, and there's nothing more tempting to a toddler than climbing into an open drawer, so we want to make sure there's no chance of load transfer that could cause danger. Our expert assembly team will supply all the required mounting hardware (in this case, angled brackets) with every assembly service, and will use a cable detector to make sure the universal hardware goes in precisely the right spot.
