With no wall to secure your Wardrobe to, and with no ceiling mount options included, doing so puts your furniture at a higher risk for tipping over. There are also visible connectors on the back side of the Wardrobe, which may require some creative masking for a more "finished" look, so it may not be ideal as a room divider. Why not try the Type01 or Type02 as a divider, instead? With 360Â° of finishing, they look great from every angle.
