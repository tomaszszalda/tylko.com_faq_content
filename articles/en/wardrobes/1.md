We're working on making our Wardrobes available Europe-wide, but as each purchase includes free in-home expert assembly (as well as free shipping), we can only offer our Wardrobes in the following countries at the moment: Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Stay tuned as we work to roll out availability, and be sure to join the waitlist to be notified when the Type03 comes to your country.
