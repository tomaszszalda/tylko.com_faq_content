At the moment, no. But we've got a clever corner shelf workaround until we do: you can easily create two separate shelves that fit together snugly when you choose the Slant style in the configurator. With its open edges, you can position them at an angle to each other to get right-to-the-corner storage space - and the look of a custom corner unit. Check out our Slant layout shelves [here](https://tylko.com/shelf/329998/?sharing=true).
