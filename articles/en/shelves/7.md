Yes, we recommend that you do. Our shelves are incredibly sturdy and stable on their own, but we suggest that you attach your shelf to a wall just to be extra safe - especially if you have one taller than 60cm or wider than 150cm (or curious cats or kids who like to climb!).

Attaching our floor-standing only furniture is easy. We provide everything you need right inside your order. You'll find the perfect amount of iron brackets and screws for your shelf, and all you'll need to do is drill a few holes to securely fix your furniture.
