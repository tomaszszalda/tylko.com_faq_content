We've made it easy to figure out the maximal shelf height you can design for your ceiling with this [easy chart](http://tips.tylko.com/en/articles/1219014-maximum-shelf-height).

We recommend referencing the maximal height for your Tylko according to your ceiling and leaving the recommended clearance distance as you design your piece. As we all know, ceilings can be notoriously uneven, and leaving enough room will give you plenty of space to set your furniture up without scraping, bumping or worse - getting stuck.
