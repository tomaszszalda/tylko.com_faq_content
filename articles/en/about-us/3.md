We offer three main ranges of furniture: the Type01 and Type02, which are flexible shelf-based storage units that you can configure, as well as the Type03 which is our customisable Wardrobe. Each Type offers numerous options to create perfect-fit furniture that fulfills all your space, style and organisational needs. We make Wardrobes, Sideboards, Chests of Drawers, TV Stands, Shoe Racks, Bookcases, Wall Storage, Cabinet Units, Cupboards, and so much more â€” but the best part is that you get to design your furniture exactly how you want it. Need a bedside table? Just configure it online and we'll build it for you. Have a narrow hallway that needs a little extra storage? We can help you with that too.
