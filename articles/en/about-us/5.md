We make every piece of furniture on demand according to the exact specs each customer has chosen. That's why we don't any physical shops - our customers create their designs and we ship directly to them with no middleman involved.

If you're curious how Tylko products look and feel before buying, you can [order Sample Sets](https://tylko.com/material-samples/) to check out the finishes, explore the range of colours and feel the quality, so that you'll feel good about your decisions. We also cooperate with businesses across Europe that use Tylko furniture in their public spaces and are happy to let potential customers explore their storage. You can check out the list [here](https://tips.tylko.com/en/articles/4407942-are-there-tylko-showrooms-or-shops).

(Please note we don't have any businesses using the Type03 Wardrobe in their space yet, but we hope to offer the possibility to check one out soon.)
