RAL colour codes are an industry standard so that colours can be accurately and consistently produced. [Here is a list](http://tips.tylko.com/en/articles/4476119-ral-colour-code-list) of the RAL colour codes for all of our products, so you can be certain of the exact shades.

You can also [order Sample Sets](https://tylko.com/material-samples/) to get your hands on actual Tylko product samples so you can see and feel the finishes for yourself.
