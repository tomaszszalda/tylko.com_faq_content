The Type01 is constructed of 18mm plywood, which is made from 13 layers of high quality Northern European birch hardwood. We leave the edges exposed (and hand-oil them) to showcase the natural grain of the wood. If you choose to add optional back panels to your Type01, they are made from high-quality particleboard and "close in" the back of your furniture to create a finished edge.

The Type01 Veneer is made from 18mm particle board and bonded with a top layer of premium-grade real wood veneer in ash or oak.
