Good question! Both the Type01 Plywood and the Type01 Veneer offer the same customisation options, but they each have their own distinct style.

The Type01 Plywood is made from 13 layers of birch plywood with a laminate finish, and exposed edges that highlight the natural beauty of the wood. If you choose optional doors or drawers, the handles are colour-matched aluminum that were designed specifically to feel great (and look amazing, of course).

The Type01 Veneer is built from 18mm particle board with a bonded layer of thin real wood veneer. Available in two woods - ash or oak - each offers a unique wood grain and warm, earthy tone, while the matching solid wood handles provide a warm, tactile experience.
