Not to any Tylko, no. Our cable management ports are only available for Sideboards with a column layout (like [this](https://tylko.com/shelf/sideboards/3222789/?cv=0&board=cat_3__type_all__id_4320&title=Type02%20Sideboard%20in%20White), for instance), or pieces showing ""+ Cable Management"" in the configurator. Same goes for TV Stands - if they're shown with  ""+ Cable Management"" within the configurator, you can easily add one of our colour-matched, magnetic cover cable ports to help keep cables tidy. Please note, the cable managment feature is not available for Bookcases or Wall Storage at present.
