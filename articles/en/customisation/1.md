The configurator is our super simple online design tool. With just a few clicks and swipes, you can design every detail of your totally custom piece of furniture. From colour, depth and dimensions, to fun add-on features that make getting (and staying) organised simple, it's all editable in real time so you can visualise your perfect piece from every angle, and see an accurate price, too.

For the Type01 and Type02 range, you can adjust the width of your furniture in 1 cm increments from 30-450cm, and the height in 10 cm increments between 23 and 403cm. You can also choose from 3 row heights and depths for our most flexible furniture yet.

The Type03 Wardrobe has the same great flexibility, too! It comes in two standard depths and heights, but can be customised for heights up to 360cm and widths between 40 and 600 cm, giving you lots of options (and room!) to hang, fold and keep your clothing.
