We know many people would like to pick and choose exactly where their doors and drawers go, so we're working on improving the placement options to give you even more control.

For now, you'll see two types of adjusters in the configurator:  the row adjuster and the column adjuster. Adding doors or drawers is only possible where the configurator allows it, and you can choose between three options: fully closed, mixed or fully open for each row of the shelf. The column adjuster meanwhile lets you customise the look of each column and choose from many options for all of our low-height storage categories.

When it comes to configuring your Wardrobe, it's a little different: simply use the configurator to choose pre-designed column segments. With 16 unique segment layouts, the perfect storage solution can be easily be customised to fit your needs. And, since you can create a Wardrobe as big as 3,6m in height and 6m in width, your storage possibilities are endless, so you can freely change the design column by column and adjust your Wardrobe from the outside and the inside.
