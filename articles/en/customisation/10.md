It's a great idea, and we'd love to offer these options, but the short answer is no, not yet. It will take a bit of extra development in our production line and design code to be able to offer the ability to combine depths and colours, not to mention rigorous safety testing to make sure shelves with different depths would still be sturdy and safe, so it's something we're still working on. We hope to offer even more customisation options soon, though!
