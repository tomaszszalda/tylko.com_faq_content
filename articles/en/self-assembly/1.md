We designed our shelves to click together easily. Each element of your furniture is pre-installed with all the mounting hardware in place, so all you have to do is align the colour-coded pieces, give them a firm push (or whack with the included soft tool or a rubber mallet you may have lying around) and they'll lock into place. We also number each flat pack box so you can open them in order to get the exact next piece you need for the most effortless assembly you've ever experienced, while your personalised manual walks you through each easy step.
